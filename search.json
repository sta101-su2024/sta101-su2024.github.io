You might also include any preliminary summary statistics or figures you use to explore the data.\n\n\nResults (15 pts)\nPlace figure(s) here to illustrate the main results from your analysis. 1 beautiful figure is worth more than several poorly formatted figures. You must have at least 1 figure.\nProvide only the main results from your analysis. The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis (calculate every possible statistic and create every possible model for all variables). Rather, you should demonstrate that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them using data, that you are skilled in writing about and interpreting results, and that you can accomplish these tasks using R. More is not better.\n\n\nDiscussion (5 pts)\nThis section is a conclusion and discussion. You should\n\nSummarize your main finding in a sentence or two.\nDiscuss your finding and why it is useful (put in the context of your motivation from the introduction).\nCritique your own analyses and include a brief paragraph on what you would do differently if you were able to start the project over.\n\n\n\nFormatting (5 pts)\nYour project should be professionally formatted. For example, this means labeling graphs and figures, turning off code chunks, using proper citations and cross-references, and following typical style guidelines.",

To do so this, we can make a frequency table of the “data set” variable. Run the code chunk below. Note: when you run the code chunk below, a table “prints” to the screen.

In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of data sets that have the same summary statistics as the original Datasaurus but have very different data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can view the whole data frame by running the code view(datasaurus_dozen) in the console.

    "text": "Exercise 2\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino data set. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this data set. Make sure that this value is printed in your document.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your .qmd document and successfully render it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |&gt;, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: &lt;-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote in R you may use either &lt;- or = for an assignment operator. We’ll use &lt;- in this class as it’s the more commonly used assignment operator, but when you look for R help online, you might see = being used as well.\n\n\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(dino_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate r only if relevant.\nIn this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear, but is instead more ‘dinosaur-esque’.\nFor illustrative purposes only, let’s calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\ndino_data |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0645",

Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nInclusive community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know!\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive.\nPlease update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course Canvas page.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Canvas, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted to the discussion board on Canvas. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on the discussion board, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the course support page under Course Information module for more resources.\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.",

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

See Section 9.2 for policies on late work.\n\nAttendance and participation\nYou are expected to be present at class meeting and actively participate in the discussion. Your attendance and participation during class, as well as your activity on the course discussion board will make up a non-insignificant portion of your grade in this class. While I might sometimes call on you during the class discussion, it is your responsibility to be an active participant without being called on. We will use Wooclap in lecture and attendance will be recorded via Wooclap participation (note: not based on answers, only completion). You will receive full credit for lecture attendance if your Wooclap participation score is at least 80%.\nYou can miss two lab meetings for any reason without penalty. Lecture and lab attendance will be equally weighted in the final attendance grade calculation.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios. Labs will focus on both computation and conceptualization. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto and submitted as PDF for grading in Gradescope. While you may collaborate with others on lab assignments, your final solution should be your own.\nLowest lab score will be dropped.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be one exam. The exam will be comprised of two components:\n\nIn class: 75 minute in-class exam. This exam is closed book, however you are allowed to use one sheet of notes (“cheat sheet”) to the exam. This sheet must be no larger than 8 1/2 x 11, and must be prepared by you. You may use both sides of the sheet. (70% of the grade)\nTake home: Following the in class exam, you’ll have 48 hours to complete the take home portion of your exam. The take home portion will follow from the in class exam and focus on the analysis of a dataset introduced in the take home exam. (30% of the grade)\n\nThrough these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analyses and computational tasks related to the content in application exercises and labs. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.\nSee Section 11 for date and time of the exam. Exam date cannot be changed and no make-up exam will be given. If you can’t take the exam on this date, you should drop this class.\n\n\nProject\nThere will be a semester-long data analysis project. The project allows you to explore a question and dataset that aligns with your interests. More details about the project will be provided during the semester. The project will be completed individually.\nSee Section 11 for dates and times of project deadlines. Project deadlines cannot be changed. If you can’t be in class for the final project presentation, you should drop this class.",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe labs must also be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to lab questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, communication with classmates at a high level is allowed however you may not share code or components of the project between students.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically result in a 0 for the assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\nPolicy on late work depends on the particular course component:\n\nLabs:\n\nLate, but within 24 hours of deadline: -20% of available points.\nAny later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback.\nNote that lowest lab score will be dropped, even if that score is a 0.\n\nExams:\n\nIn class portions of the exams can obviously not be turned in late.\nLate exams are not accepted.\n\nProjects: The following three components contribute to your project score.\n\nPresentation: Late presentations are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed presentations.\nWrite up: if you need to submit your work late, email me.\n\nLate, but within 24 hours of deadline: -20% of available points.\nAny later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email the me (kat.husar@duke.edu) before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nEvery effort will be made to mark your work accurately. We are on your side, and want you to receive every point you have worked to earn. However, sometimes grading mistakes happen. If you believe that an error has been made, return the paper to the instructor within four days, stating your claim in writing.\nThe following claims will be considered for re-grading:\n\npoints are not totaled correctly;\nthe grader did not see a correct answer that is on your paper;\nyour answer is the same as the correct answer, but in a different form (e.g., you wrote a correct answer as 1/3 and the grader was looking for 0.333);\nyour answer to a free response question is essentially correct but stated slightly differently than the grader’s expectation.\n\nThe following claims will not be considered for re-grading:\n\narguments about the number of points lost;\narguments about question wording.\n\nConsidering re-grades consumes time and resources that TA and the instructor would rather spend helping you understand material. Please bring only claims of type 1-4 to our attention.\nNote that during the regrade process your score could go up or go down or not change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\nNote that attendance and participation is part of your grade as well.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919- 681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously, we may rely on Duke’s designated make-up days, or you may be asked to watch a recording of the class.",

SDAO will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to me. Please contact SDAO for more information: sdao@duke.edu or access.duke.edu.\n\n\nReligious accommodations\nStudents are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays.\nNote: If you’ve read this far in the syllabus, email me a picture of your pet if you have one or your favorite meme!",
