The income and education differences in drinking are typically larger than those seen by other demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, race, region, and religion.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the distribution of data from a Gallup poll that asked respondents about their preferred alcoholic beverage (beer, wine, or liquor) and their income bracket.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!--# The associated Gallup study can be found at http://www.gallup.com/poll/184358/drinking-highest-among-educated-upper-income-americans.aspx?g_source=CATEGORY_WELLBEING&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles\n%The numbers here were made up so that the percentage of alcohol type reflected the percentages found in the study, based a total of 1009 polled Americans. However, no information was given on how many people were sampled from each income bracket/education level, so those figures were made up -->\n```\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{lrrrr}\n\\toprule\nIncome & Beer & Wine & Liquor & Total \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nLess than \\$30,000 & 83 & 67 & 44 & 194 \\\\ \n\\$30,000 - \\$74,999 & 213 & 161 & 126 & 500 \\\\ \n\\$75,000 or more & 110 & 116 & 80 & 306 \\\\ \nTotal & 406 & 344 & 250 & 1000 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 1\n\nIn evaluating the relationship between these two variables, what is the response variable and what is the explanatory variable?\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{2cm}$\n:::\n\n## Question 2\n\nWhich of the following are appropriate visualizations for these data?

In your answer, describe how you arrived at your answer.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{2cm}$\n:::\n\n## Question 7\n\nBased on your answer to the previous question, what is the conclusion of the hypothesis test at the 5% discernibility level?\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{2cm}$\n:::\n\n# Part 2 - Employment\n\nA large university knows that about 70% of the full-time students are employed at least 5 hours per week. The members of the Statistics Department wonder if the same proportion of their students work at least 5 hours per week. They randomly sample 25 majors and find that 15 of the students (60%) work 5 or more hours each week.\n\n## Question 8\n\nDescribe how you can set up a simulation to estimate the proportion of statistics majors who work 5 or more hours each week based on this sample.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{2cm}$\n:::\n\n## Question 9\n\nA bootstrap distribution with 1000 simulations is show below. Approximate the bounds of the 90% confidence interval based on this distribution.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exam-2-review_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 10\n\nSuppose the lower bound of the confidence interval from the previous question is L and the upper bound is U. Which of the following is correct?\n\na\\. Between L to U of statistics majors work at least 5 hours per week.\n\nb\\. 95% of the time the true proportion of statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week is between L and U.\n\nc\\. Between L and U of random samples of 25 statistics majors are expected to yield confidence intervals that contain the true proportion of statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week.\n\nd\\. 95% of random samples of 25 statistics majors will yield confidence intervals between L and U.\n\ne\\. None of the above.\n\n## Question 11\n\nEstimate the standard error of the bootstrap distribution.\n\n# Part 3 - Miscellaneous\n\n## Question 12\n\n**Choose the best answer.**\n\nA survey based on a random sample of 2,045 American teenagers found that a 95% confidence interval for the mean number of texts sent per month was (1450, 1550). A valid interpretation of this interval is\n\na.  95% of all teens who text send between 1450 and 1550 text messages per month.\nb.  If a new survey with the same sample size were to be taken, there is a 95% chance that the mean number of texts in the sample would be between 1450 and 1550.\nc.  We are 95% confident that the mean number of texts per month of all American teens is between 1450 and 1550.\nd.  We are 95% confident that, were we to repeat this survey, the mean number of texts per month of those taking part in the survey would be between 1450 and 1550.\n\n## Question 13\n\n**Which is bigger?**\n\nA researcher is planning to conduct a test of two proportions. The null hypothesis is $H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0$. The researcher has found that in their data $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 = 0.2$.\n\nI. P-value associated if $H_A: p_1 - p_2 \\ne 0$ II. P-value associated if $H_A: p_1 - p_2 > 0$\n\na.  I \\> II\nb.  I \\< II\nc.  I = II\n\n## Question 14\n\n**Fill in the blanks.**\n\na\\. Power of the test is the probability of \\_\\_\\_.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{1cm}$\n:::\n\nb\\. Type 1 error rate is the probability of \\_\\_\\_.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{1cm}$\n:::\n\nc\\. Type 2 error rate is the probability of \\_\\_\\_.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{1cm}$\n:::\n\nd\\. Unbeknownst to you, let’s say that the null hypothesis is actually true in the population. You plan to run a study anyway. If the level of discernibility you choose (i.e., the cutoff for your p-value) is 0.05, the probability that you will mistakenly reject the null hypothesis is \\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{1cm}$\n:::\n\n## Question 15\n\n**True or false.** And, if false, explain your reasoning.\n\na\\. The central limit theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of a sample proportion will be centered at $\\hat{p}$.\n\nb\\. Increasing the number of bootstrap samples will decrease the width of the confidence interval.\n\nc\\. The bootstrap distribution of a sample proportion, $\\hat{p}$, will be centered at $\\hat{p}$.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{2cm}$\n:::\n\n## Bonus\n\nPick a concept we introduced in class so far that you've been struggling with and explain it in your own words.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n$\\vspace{2cm}$\n:::\n",
