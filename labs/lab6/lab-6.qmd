# Getting started

1.  Go to [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers) and create a new folder titled **lab-6 - Ethics**.

2.  Download the files from [Canvas]() and upload them into the new folder you created in step 1.

3.  Complete the exercises in this document.

# Part 1: Ethics

## Exercise 1

a.  What is misleading about this graph?

b.  Suppose you wanted to recreate this plot, with improvements to avoid its misleading pitfalls from part (a). You would obviously need the data from the survey in order to be able to do that. How many observations would this data have? How many variables (at least) should it have, and what should those variables be?

c.  Load the data for this survey from `survation.csv`. Confirm that the data match the percentages from the visualization. That is, calculate the percentages of public sector, private sector, don't know for each of the services and check that they match the percentages from the plot.

d.  Recreate the visualization, and improve it. You only need to submit the improved version, not a recreation of the misleading graph exactly. Does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?

## Pause and render

Now that you've completed a few exercises, pause and render your document. If it renders without any issues, great! Move on to the next exercise. If it does not, debug the issue before moving on. Ask for help if you need. Do not proceed without rendering your document.

## Exercise 2

A data scientist compiled data from several public sources (voter registration, political contributions, tax records) that were used to predict sexual orientation of individuals in a community. What ethical considerations arise that should guide use of such data sets?[^1]

[^1]: This exercise is from [MDSR, Chp 8](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-ethics.html#ethics-exercises).


## Exercise 3

A data analyst received permission to post a data set that was scraped from a social media site. The full data set included name, screen name, email address, geographic location, IP (internet protocol) address, demographic profiles, and preferences for relationships. Why might it be problematic to post a deidentified form of this data set where name and email address were removed?[^2]

[^2]: This exercise is from [MDSR, Chp 8](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-ethics.html#ethics-exercises).

## Exercise 4

To complete this exercise you will first need to watch the documentary Coded Bias. To do so, you either need to be on the Duke network or connected to the Duke VPN. Then go to <https://find.library.duke.edu/catalog/DUKE009834953> and click on "View Online". Once you watch the video, write a one paragraph reflection highlighting at least one thing that you already knew about (from the course prep materials) and at least one thing you learned from the movie as well as any other aspects of the documentary that you found interesting / enlightening.

# Wrap up

## Submitting

::: callout-important
Before you proceed, first, make sure that you have updated the document YAML with your name! Then, render your document one last time, for good measure.

To submit your assignment to Gradescope:

-   Go to your Files pane and check the box next to the PDF output of your document (`lab-6.pdf`).

-   Then, in the Files pane, go to More \> Export. This will download the PDF file to your computer. Save it somewhere you can easily locate, e.g., your Downloads folder or your Desktop.

-   Go to the course Canvas page and click on Gradescope and then click on the assignment. You'll be prompted to submit it.

-   Mark the pages associated with each exercise. All of the papers of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be "checked").

::: callout-warning
If you fail to mark the pages associated with an exercise, that exercise won't be graded. This means, if you fail to mark the pages for all exercises, you will receive a 0 on the assignment. The TA can't mark your pages for you, and for them to be able to grade, you must mark them.
