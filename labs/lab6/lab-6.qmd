# Learning Goals

-   Critiquing visualizations that misrepresent data
-   Improving data visualizations to better convey the right message

# Getting started

1.  Go to [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers) and create a new folder titled **lab-6 - Ethics**.

2.  Download the files from [Canvas](https://canvas.duke.edu/courses/32831/pages/mon-jun-10-inference-with-mathematical-models) and upload them into the new folder you created in step 1.

3.  Complete the exercises in this document.


# Ethics

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualization.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

In this lab you'll construct the data set!

# Exercises

The following visualization was shared [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JonBoeckenstedt/status/1291602888376999936) as "extraordinary misleading".

## Exercise 1

::: exercise
What is misleading about this visualization and how you might go about fixing it?
:::


## Exercise 2

::: exercise
Create a data frame that can be used to re-construct this visualization. You may need to guess some of the numbers, that's ok. You should first think about how many rows and columns you'll need and what you want to call your variables. Then, you can use the tribble() function for this. For example, if you wanted to construct the following data frame

```{r}
#| label: tribble
#| echo: true
df <- tribble(
  ~date, ~count,
  "1/1/2020", 15,
  "2/1/2020", 20,
  "3/1/2020", 22,
)
```

You can create the data frame below. Print the first 5 rows of the data frame after creating it. You may name the data frame what you like. We often try and keep data frame names small and informative.

## Exercise 3

::: exercise
Make a visualization that more accurately (and honestly) tells the story.
:::

## Exercise 4

::: exercise
 What message is more clear in your visualization than it was in the original visualization?

:::

## Exercise 5

::: exercise
5.  What, if any, useful information do these data and your visualization tell us about mask wearing and COVID? Answers should focus only on what the visualization tells.

# Wrap up

## Submitting

::: callout-important
Before you proceed, first, make sure that you have updated the document YAML with your name! Then, render your document one last time, for good measure.

To submit your assignment to Gradescope:

-   Go to your Files pane and check the box next to the PDF output of your document (`lab-6.pdf`).

-   Then, in the Files pane, go to More \> Export. This will download the PDF file to your computer. Save it somewhere you can easily locate, e.g., your Downloads folder or your Desktop.

-   Go to the course Canvas page and click on Gradescope and then click on the assignment. You'll be prompted to submit it.

-   Mark the pages associated with each exercise. All of the papers of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be "checked").

::: callout-warning
If you fail to mark the pages associated with an exercise, that exercise won't be graded. This means, if you fail to mark the pages for all exercises, you will receive a 0 on the assignment. The TA can't mark your pages for you, and for them to be able to grade, you must mark them.

## Grading
| Component             | Points |
|:----------------------|:-------|
| Ex 1                  | 5      |
| Ex 2                  | 5      |
| Ex 3                  | 15     |
| Ex 4                  | 5      |
| Ex 5                  | 5      |
| **Total**             | **35** |
