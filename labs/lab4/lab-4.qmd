title: "Lab 4"
---

By the end of this lab you will create and fit regression models with a single predictor and visualize a simple regression model.

For all visualizations you create, b sure to include informative titles for the plot, axes, and legend!

# Getting started

1.  Go to [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers) and create a new folder titled **lab-4 - Regression with a single predictor**.

2.  Download the files from [Canvas](https://canvas.duke.edu/courses/32831/pages/thu-may-30-logistic-regression-ii) and upload them into the new folder you created in step 1.

3.  Complete the exercises in this document.

# Packages

In this lab we will work with the tidyverse packages, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

# Part 1: Do you even lift?

Today, we will be working with data from [www.openpowerlifting.org](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/). This data was sourced from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-08) and contains international powerlifting records at various meets. At each meet, each lifter gets three attempts at lifting max weight on three lifts: the bench press, squat and deadlift.

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| message: false

ipf <- read_csv("ipf.csv")
```

The data dictionary for this dataset from TidyTuesday is reproduced below:

For all of the following exercises, you should include units on axes labels, e.g. "Bench press (lbs)" or "Bench press (kg)". "Age (years)" etc. This is good practice.

## Exercise 1

::: exercise
Let's begin by taking a look at the **squat lifting** records.

To begin, remove any observations that are negative for squat. Next, create a new column called `best3_squat_lbs` that converts the record from kg to lbs (you may have to google the conversion). Save your data frame as `ipf_squat`. Report the number of rows and columns of this new data frame using inline code.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Hint

First, you're taking a dataset and `filter`ing it for certain records, and then you're `mutate`-ing that dataset to gain a new column, and you're assigning the resulting dataset to a new object called `ipf_squat`.
:::

## Exercise 2

::: exercise
Using `ipf_squat` from the previous exercise, create a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between squat (in lbs) and age. Age should be on the x-axis. Adjust the `alpha` level of your points to get a better sense of the density of the data. Add a linear trend-line. Be sure to label all axes and give the plot a title. Comment on what you observe.
:::

## Exercise 3

::: exercise
Write down the linear model to predict lift squat lbs from age in $x$, $y$, $\beta$ notation. What is $x$? What is $y$? Next, fit the linear model, and save it as `age_fit`. Re-write your previous equation replacing $\beta$ with the numeric estimates. This is called the "fitted" linear model. Interpret each estimate of $\beta$. Are the interpretations sensible?
:::

## Exercise 4

::: exercise
Building on your `ipf_squat` data frame, create a new column called `age2` that takes the age of each lifter and squares it. Save it to your data frame `ipf_squat`. Next, plot squat in lbs vs `age2` and add a linear best fit line. Does this model look like it fits the data better?
:::

::: callout-tip
## Hint

To raise a value to a power, use `^` in R, e.g.: `2 ^ 2` gives you 4, `2 ^ 3` gives you 8, etc.
:::

## Exercise 5

::: exercise
One metric to assess the fit of a model is the correlation squared, also known as $R^2$. Fit the age$^2$ model and save the object as `age2_fit`. Subsequently run

```{r}
#| eval: false

glance(age2_fit)$r.squared
```

to examine the $R^2$. Compare $R^2$ of the age$^2$ model to the $R^2$ of the model from Exercise 3. Which has a higher $R^2$?
:::

::: callout-note
$R^2$ values range from 0 to 1. Values close to 0 means weak correlation between the variables whereas $R^2 = 1$ implies perfect correlation. You can (optionally) read more about $R^2$ in section [7.2.5 of the book](https://openintro-ims2.netlify.app/model-slr.html#r-squared). We'll pick up here in the next class.
:::

## Exercise 6

::: exercise
Next, let's turn our attention to **dead lifting** records.

Recreate the plot below. Make sure axes and title labels are exactly matching, including spelling, capitalization, etc. Based on the plot below, which impacts deadlift weight more, age category or sex?
:::

::: callout-note
## Hint

You will need to create a couple of new columns. One to classify age appropriately and one to convert `best3deadlift_kg` to the plotted units (lbs). Notice that there are no negative deadlift values on the x-axis.
:::

```{r}
#| label: deadlift-age-sex-plot
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.8
#| echo: false

ipf |>
  mutate(Age = ifelse(age < 40, "Under 40", "40 or older")) |>
  filter(!is.na(Age)) |>
  filter(best3deadlift_kg > 0 ) |>
  mutate(best3deadlift_lbs = best3deadlift_kg * 2.20462) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = best3deadlift_lbs, fill = sex, color = sex))  +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ Age, ncol = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of best deadlift in lbs by age grouping and sex", 
    y = "Density", 
    x = "Best deadlift (lbs)",
    color = "Sex", fill = "Sex"
  )
```

## Exercise 7

::: exercise
Finally, let's turn our attention to **bench press** records.

To begin, remove any observations that are negative for bench press, create two new columns: `best3bench_lbs` and `bodyweight_lbs`. Save the result in a new data frame called `ipf_bench`.

Then, create a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between best bench press (in lbs) and the lifter's bodyweight (in lbs). Bodyweight should be on the x-axis. Add a linear trend-line. Be sure to label all axes and give the plot a title. Comment on what you observe.
:::

## Exercise 8

::: exercise
Fit the linear model displayed in the previous exercise and write down the **fitted model equation** only, replacing $\hat{\beta}$s with their fitted estimates. Interpret the $\hat{\beta}$s (intercept and slope). Report $R^2$. Is body weight an important predictor of bench press ability? Why or why not?

## Submitting

::: callout-important
Before you proceed, first, make sure that you have updated the document YAML with your name! Then, render your document one last time, for good measure.
:::

To submit your assignment to Gradescope:

-   Go to your Files pane and check the box next to the PDF output of your document (`lab-3.pdf`).

-   Then, in the Files pane, go to More \> Export. This will download the PDF file to your computer. Save it somewhere you can easily locate, e.g., your Downloads folder or your Desktop.

-   Go to the course Canvas page and click on Gradescope and then click on the assignment. You'll be prompted to submit it.

-   Mark the pages associated with each exercise. All of the papers of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be "checked").

::: callout-warning
If you fail to mark the pages associated with an exercise, that exercise won't be graded. This means, if you fail to mark the pages for all exercises, you will receive a 0 on the assignment. The TAs can't mark your pages for you, and for them to be able to grade, you must mark them.
