# **Inference with mathematical models**

## That familiar shape...

::: task
Describe the shape of the distributions.

## It's not happenstance!

It's the **Central Limit Theorem**, which says that the distribution of the sample statistic is normal, if certain conditions are met.

::: task
Two questions:

1.  What do we mean by the distribution of the sample statistic?
2.  What conditions need to be met?
:::

## The distribution of the sample statistic

::: incremental
-   You can build the distribution of the sample statistic by repeatedly taking samples of size n (original sample size) from the population and calculating and recording the sample statistic for each of these samples.

-   But, you would never do this in reality!

-   You'd either use simulation (randomization, bootstrapping, stuff we've done so far!) or you would leverage mathematical theory to know what to expect if we *had* taken repeated samples.


## The (technical) conditions

1.  **Independent observations:** Observations in the sample are independent. Independence is guaranteed when we take a random sample from a population. Independence can also be guaranteed if we randomly divide individuals into treatment and control groups.

2.  **Large enough sample:** The sample size cannot be too small. What qualifies as "small" differs from one context (i.e., from sample statistic to sample statistic).

## More to the CLT

-   There is more to the CLT than just the **shape** of the distribution -- normal.

-   The CLT says that the **center** of the sampling distribution will be at the true population parameter.

-   The CLT also says something about the **spread** of the sampling distribution, measured by the **standard error**. For each sample statistic ($\bar{x}$ -- the sample mean, $\hat{p}$ -- the sample proportion, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ -- the difference in sample means, etc.) the CLT provides a formula for its standard error.

    -   You won't be asked to memorize these formulas.

    -   In fact, you'll rarely use the CLT to calculate the variability of sample statistics, you'll simulate their distributions directly.

# Normal distribution

## Normal distributions

::: task
How are these normal distributions similar? How are they different? Which one is $N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)$ and which $N(\mu = 19, \sigma = 4)$?

## **The 68-95-99.7 rule**

The normal distribution is not just *any* unimodal and symmetric distribution, it follows the **68-95-99.7 rule**.

## Using the normal distribution...

-   To make decisions $\rightarrow$ hypothesis testing

    -   Use properties of the normal distribution to determine the probability of the observed sample statistic (or something more extreme, in the direction of the alternative hypothesis), i.e. the p-value


-   To make estimations $\rightarrow$ confidence intervals

    -   Use properties of the normal distribution to calculate the bounds of the confidence interval, adding and subtracting a margin of error to the observed sample statistic



# Goals

-   Calculate probabilities under the normal curve

-   Understand Z scores

-   Build intuition for hypothesis testing and confidence interval building with the normal distribution

# Packages and data

We'll use the **tidyverse** and **openintro** packages.

# Bone density - population

Suppose the bone density for 65-year-old women is normally distributed with mean 809 $mg/cm^3$ and standard deviation of 140 $mg/cm^3$.

Let $x$ be the bone density of 65-year-old women. We can write this distribution of $x$ in mathematical notation as

$$
x \sim N(\mu = 809, \sigma = 140)
$$

Let's set the parameters of this distribution as objects you can use later.

```{r}
#| label: population-parameters

bone_density_mean <- 809
bone_density_sd <- 140
```

## Exercise 1

Visualize the distribution of bone density of 65-year-old women.

```{r}
#| label: viz-pop

# add code here
```

## Exercise 2

Before typing any code, based on what you know about the normal distribution, what do you expect the median bone density to be?

*Add response here.*

## Exercise 3

What bone densities correspond to Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 (50th percentile), and Q3 (the 75th percentile) of this distribution? Use the `qnorm()` function to calculate these values.

```{r}
#| label: quartiles

# add code here
```

## Exercise 4

The densities of three woods are below:

-   Plywood: 540 $mg/cm^3$

-   Pine: 600 $mg/cm^3$

-   Mahogany: 710 $mg/cm^3$

Let's set these as variables we can use later:

```{r}
#| label: trees

plywood <- 540
pine <- 600
mahogany <- 710
```

What is the probability that a randomly selected 65-year-old woman has bones less dense than Pine?

```{r}
#| label: pine-pop

# add code here
```

## Exercise 5

Would you be surprised if a randomly selected 65-year-old woman had bone density less than Mahogany? What if she had bone density less than Plywood? Use the respective probabilities to support your response.

*Add response here.*

```{r}
#| label: mahogany-plywood-pop

# add code here
```

# Bone density - sampling

Suppose you want to analyze the mean bone density for a group of 10 randomly selected 65-year-old women.

## Exercise 6

*Add response here.*

## Exercise 7

```{r}
#| label: pine-sampling

## Exercise 9

Would you be surprised if a group of 10 randomly-selected 65-year old women had a mean bone density less than Mahogany? What the group had a mean bone density less than Plywood? Use the respective probabilities to support your response.
