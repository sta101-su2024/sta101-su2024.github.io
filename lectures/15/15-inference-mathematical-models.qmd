# **Inference with mathematical models**

## That familiar shape...

::: task
Describe the shape of the distributions.

## It's not happenstance!

It's the **Central Limit Theorem**, which says that the distribution of the sample statistic is normal, if certain conditions are met.

. . .

::: task
Two questions:

1.  What do we mean by the distribution of the sample statistic?
2.  What conditions need to be met?
:::

## The distribution of the sample statistic

::: incremental
-   You can build the distribution of the sample statistic by repeatedly taking samples of size n (original sample size) from the population and calculating and recording the sample statistic for each of these samples.

-   But, you would never do this in reality!

-   You'd either use simulation (randomization, bootstrapping, stuff we've done so far!) or you would leverage mathematical theory to know what to expect if we *had* taken repeated samples.
:::

## The (technical) conditions

1.  **Independent observations:** Observations in the sample are independent. Independence is guaranteed when we take a random sample from a population. Independence can also be guaranteed if we randomly divide individuals into treatment and control groups.

2.  **Large enough sample:** The sample size cannot be too small. What qualifies as "small" differs from one context (i.e., from sample statistic to sample statistic).

## More to the CLT

-   There is more to the CLT than just the **shape** of the distribution -- normal.

-   The CLT says that the **center** of the sampling distribution will be at the true population parameter.

-   The CLT also says something about the **spread** of the sampling distribution, measured by the **standard error**. For each sample statistic ($\bar{x}$ -- the sample mean, $\hat{p}$ -- the sample proportion, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ -- the difference in sample means, etc.) the CLT provides a formula for its standard error.

    -   You won't be asked to memorize these formulas.

    -   In fact, you'll rarely use the CLT to calculate the variability of sample statistics, you'll simulate their distributions directly.

# Normal distribution

## Normal distributions

::: task
How are these normal distributions similar? How are they different? Which one is $N(\mu = 0, \sigma. 1)$ and which $N(\mu = 19, \sigma = 4)$?

## **The 68-95-99.7 rule**

The normal distribution is not just *any* unimodal and symmetric distribution, it follows the **68-95-99.7 rule**.

## Using the normal distribution...

-   To make decisions $\rightarrow$ hypothesis testing

    -   Use properties of the normal distribution to determine the probability of the observed sample statistic (or something more extreme, in the direction of the alternative hypothesis), i.e. the p-value

. . .

-   To make estimations $\rightarrow$ confidence intervals

    -   Use properties of the normal distribution to calculate the bounds of the confidence interval, adding and subtracting a margin of error to the observed sample statistic

. . .

But before then...
