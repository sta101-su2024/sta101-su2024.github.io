[**Kat Husar**](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/kat.husar) (she/her) - Hi everyone! I am a second year PhD student at the [Department of Statistical Science](#0) at Duke University working with professor [Alex Volfovsky](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/alexander.volfovsky) and professor [Fan Li](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/fli). My research interest lies in causal inference.

Prior to starting at Duke, I completed my undergraduate degree at The Ohio State University majoring in mathematics and data analytics.

During my free time, I like to go on walks, hang out with my friends, bake, and spend time with my cat.
